# Python SimulinkDLL

Run your Simulink models & libraries in Python.

## Motivation

1. Running model in the loop tests with Simulink becomes time consuming with Matlab & Simulink overhead. There are ways to reduce it (Model reference, etc) however nothing has shown to be as fast as a precompiled shared library.

2. Python has a very mature set of tools and packages to automate testing.

3. Testing can be distributed to machines without Matlab/Simulink licenses.

## Use cases

1. Use Python and it's ecosystem to run complex Simulink models.
2. Use Python & pytest to run Model-in-the-Loop (MIL) tests on Simulink subsystems.
3. Give Simulink algorithms to developers without Matlab/Simulink licenses to use.
4. Start a programming language war at your company.

##  Disclaimer

This repository is a set of instructions, with examples, on how to create a Pythonic wrapper for Simulink models. It is not a turnkey Python module to do this:

```python
import simulinkdll
simulinkdll.run("my_model.slx")
```

For a given library or model this should only need done when the Python interface changes.

### High level instructions.

1. [Create a shared library in Simulink.](https://www.mathworks.com/help/ecoder/ug/creating-and-using-host-based-shared-libraries.html)
2. Create Python representations of all items in the header file.
3. Open the DLL in Python and run the model.

# Examples

### [Simple DLL Export](Example1)

For demonstrating minimal dll functionality and the steps required to run a model in Python.
